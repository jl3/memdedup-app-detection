# memdedup-app-detection

This is the code of the tools developed for the research in our papers:

 * Lindemann, J., Fischer, M.: A Memory-Deduplication Side-Channel Attack to Detect Applications in Co-Resident Virtual Machines. In: ACM Symposium on Applied Computing (SAC) (2018).

 * Lindemann, J., Fischer, M.: Efficient Identification of Applications in Co-Resident VMs via a Memory Side-Channel. In: ICT Systems Security and Privacy Protection, 33rd IFIP TC 11 International Conference (IFIP SEC) (2018).

 * Lindemann, J., Fischer, M.: On the Detection of Applications in Co-Resident Virtual Machines via a Memory Deduplication Side-Channel. In: ACM Applied Computing Review (ACR), Winter 2018.

The code demonstrates how unique pages in application versions can be identified automatically. These can then be used as a signature for detecting application versions running in co-resident virtual machines using a side-channel enabled by memory deduplication.
